Woven fabrics offer the toughest textile for high temperature applications. From standard weave patterns for general industrial applications, to fabrics woven with our exclusive stop-tear patterns, we design textiles with purpose. Combining in-house weaving technology with the full range of high temperature fibers gives us the ability to meet almost any high temperature application.
