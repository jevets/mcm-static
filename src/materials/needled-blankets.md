Different applications require different fiber properties. McAllister Mills maximizes insulation blanket performance by using a full breadth of high temperature, high performance fibers. From cryogenics to over 2000ºF (1100ºC), we select from glass, basalt, silica and rock fibers. Only non-carcinogenic fibers are used in our products. TREO, our high temperature rock fiber is actually made from post industrial waste, repurposing this otherwise waste material into a superior insulation. Pure silica needled mat provides 2000ºF protection for the most demanding applications.
