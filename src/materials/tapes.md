Woven tapes offer the toughest textile for high temperature textiles. From standard weave patterns for gernal industrial applications, to tapes woven with our exclusive twill, we design textiles with purpose. Combining in-house weaving technology with the full range of high temperature fibers gives us the ability to meet almost any high temperature application.
