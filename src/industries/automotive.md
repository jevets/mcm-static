## Transportaion Industry Heat Shields and Insulation

Engine, emission and exhaust thermal energy are best managed when the right thermal composites are specified. From McAllister Mills TREO vibration resistant insulation to Ricochet reflective textiles and basalt fiber sleeving, we can design the optimum solution. If thin and lightweight performance are critical, our microporous insulations can be combined with most any facing or encapsulation system. Custom hardware, air gap management are but a few of the many additional ways McAllister Mill brings knowhow to your engine, battery or exhaust issue. In many product designs, passive fire protection can also be achieved.
