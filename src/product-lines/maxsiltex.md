Maxsil®Tex textiles deliver the highest level of temperature performance. Not a leached glass textile, Maxsil-Tex products are made from high purity silica fibers. Maxsil-Tex fibers have virtually no shrinkage, so no property degrading fabric pre-shrinking after treatment of the textiles is required to maintain dimensional stability. Maxsil-Tex fibers elevate temperature resistance above leached glass and maintain dimensional stability and flexibility at maximum service temperature.
