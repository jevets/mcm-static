A solution to foil laminated textiles, Ricochet uses vapor deposition technology to cover and bond molten aluminum directly to the woven textile. Foil laminates have a weak link where the adhesive fails at moderate temperature, and the fabric no longer acts as a single structure, and the backing fabric and foil react independently resulting in early failure. Only ricochet has the permament bond of aluminum and fiberglass that keep peak performance to 1100ºF service temperature. Available with a weather resistant coating, this material is the ultimate choice for reflective textiles.
