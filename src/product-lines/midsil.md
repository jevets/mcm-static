Many applications require a cost effective way to service high temperature above 1000ºF, or the useful range of fiberglass. MidSil, exclusively from McAllister Mills, offers a tough alternative with a 1350ºF service temperature. More durable in its operating range than leached glass silica textiles, MidSil now offers a superior alternative for applications from 900ºF to 1350ºF. MidSil textiles also offers fabrics with comingled wire for extra durability and dimensional stability.
